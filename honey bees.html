    <h1>Honey bees</h1><br>

  <mark>  Honey bees are essential to the environment and food supply</mark>, and here are some facts about them:
    Role in pollination: Honey bees are the primary pollinators, spreading pollen from flower to flower as they collect
    nectar. This helps flowers grow into fruits and vegetables.
    Honey production: Honey bees make honey by collecting nectar from flowers, carrying it back to the hive, and turning it
    into honey. They store the honey in honeycombs, which are waxy structures made by the bees.
    Communication: Honey bees communicate with each other through a special dance called the “waggle dance”. The angle and
    duration of the dance convey important information about the location of food.
    Colony life: Honey bees live in large groups called colonies, with thousands of bees. A colony can contain up to 60,000
    bees.
    Hive structure: A hive is the home of a honey bee colony, where they store food and take care of their young.
    Bee anatomy: Honey bees have five eyes and six legs.
    Bee recognition: Honey bees can recognize human faces.
    Bee vision: Honey bees can see ultraviolet light.
    Bee navigation: Honey bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the Sun, by the
    polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the Earth's magnetic field.
    Bee sting: Honey bees only sting once.
